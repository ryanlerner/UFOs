# UFOs

## Overview of Analysis
This analysis was intended to produce an interactive webpage with tables that filter the results of UFO sightings data. Originally, this webpage was only created with a date filter. However, this project also supplied filters for state, city, country, and shape to give users additional options for how to filter this data.  

## Results
The filter tool on this webpage is a fairly straightforward process. This filter tool previously only gave the option to filter by date, which would be accomplished by simply inputting a date in the 'mm/dd/yyyy' format. This search would bring up all results reported from the exact date entered. After adding the extra filters, we can also filter data by state, country, city and shape. The grayed out placeholders shown below are meant to demonstrate how to properly format each filter search. For example, when searching a state, you would have to use the lowercase state abbreviation. Searching "New York" or "NY" to find results from New York would not yield any results. When the user correctly inputs a filter, the table will update automatically (as shown below).

## Summary 
While this webpage's interactive feature is very user-friendly, the system is not completely perfect. One drawback of this webpage is that it's not also optimized to be viewed on phones and/or tablets. This webpage is only suited to be viewed on a computer desktop, and will not automatically resize when being viewed on other devices. It would be helpful for mobile users if this wepbage was revised to optimize this table for phones.

To further develop this webpage, I would recommend adding a function that doesn't just filter data by certain criteria, but also sorts this data. For example, it currently appears that this data is being organized by earliest sightings starting on 1/1/2010. It would be useful for the user if they could sort by most recent viewings rather than a specific date. Along these same lines, there could also be a feature to filter by a specific month or year rather than just one day. The sort function could also expand to other categories so that one could see these UFO sightings grouped together by state/country/city.
